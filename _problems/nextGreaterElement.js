/*
Given an array of N elements, find the next greater element for each element
 in the array, print -1 if it does not exits. Refer to the sample I/O for better understanding
*/

function nextGreaterElement(arr,n){

}


console.log(nextGreaterElement([1,2,3,4]),4)//[3, 4, 4, -1]

/*
EXPLANATION
In the sample test case, the array contains 4 elements, and for the first element, 
the next greater element will be 3, similarly for the next element, the next greater 
element will be 4, and for the third element as well, the next greater element will be 4.
 Since, the last element has no elements ahead of it, the next greater element will be -1.
